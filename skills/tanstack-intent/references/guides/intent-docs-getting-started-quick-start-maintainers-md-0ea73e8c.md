## Initial Setup (With Agent)

### 1. Scaffold skills

Start the scaffolding process **with your AI agent**:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest scaffold
```

This prints a comprehensive prompt that walks you and your agent through three phases:

**Phase 1: Domain Discovery**
- Scans your documentation, source code, and GitHub issues
- Conducts an interactive interview to surface implicit knowledge
- Produces `domain_map.yaml` and `skill_spec.md` artifacts

**Phase 2: Tree Generation**
- Designs a skill taxonomy based on the domain map
- Creates a hierarchical skill structure
- Produces `skill_tree.yaml` artifact

**Phase 3: Skill Generation**
- Writes complete SKILL.md files for each skill
- Includes patterns, failure modes, and API references
- Validates against the Intent specification

> [!NOTE]
> Plan for multiple review rounds and regular context compaction. The agent scans documentation, recent issues, and discussions, then asks targeted questions about implicit knowledge and common failure modes. Provide concrete patterns, pitfalls, and real-world usage problems to improve the generated skills.

### 2. Validate skills

After scaffolding, validate that all SKILL.md files are well-formed:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest validate
```

This checks skill structure:

- Valid YAML frontmatter in every SKILL.md
- Required fields (`name`, `description`) are present
- Skill `name` is a leaf segment matching its parent directory
- Description length <= 1024 characters
- Line count limits (500 lines max per skill)

It also checks Intent metadata and artifacts:

- Intent-specific scalars (`type`, `library`, `library_version`, `framework`) live under `metadata`, not at the top level
- Framework skills have a `requires` array
- Required artifact files exist and are non-empty; YAML artifacts parse successfully

### 3. Commit skills and artifacts

Commit both generated skills and the artifacts used to create them:

```
skills/
  core/SKILL.md
  react/SKILL.md
  _artifacts/
    domain_map.yaml
    skill_spec.md
    skill_tree.yaml
```

Artifacts enforce a consistent skill structure across versions, making it easier to audit, refresh, or extend the skill set without starting from scratch.

## Publish Configuration

### 4. Configure your package for publishing

Run these commands to prepare your package for skill publishing:

```bash
# Update package.json with required fields
npx @tanstack/intent@latest edit-package-json

# Copy the CI workflow template
npx @tanstack/intent@latest setup
```

**What these do:**

- `edit-package-json` adds:
  - `tanstack-intent` keyword (used for package detection and registry discovery)
  - `files` array entries for `skills/`
  - For single packages: also adds `!skills/_artifacts` to exclude artifacts from npm
  - For monorepos: skips the artifacts exclusion (artifacts live at repo root)
- `setup` copies `check-skills.yml` to `.github/workflows/` for automated validation and staleness checking

`setup` does not overwrite existing workflow files. To pick up newer generated workflows, delete or move the old generated files in `.github/workflows/`, then rerun `npx @tanstack/intent@latest setup`.

If your repo already has an older generated `validate-skills.yml`, remove it after adopting the current `check-skills.yml`; PR validation now runs from `check-skills.yml`.

### 5. Ship skills with your package

Skills ship inside your npm package. When you publish:

```bash
npm publish
```

Consumers who install your library automatically get the skills. They discover local installed skills with `intent list`, add loading guidance with `intent install`, and load matching skills with `intent load`.

**Version alignment:**
- Skills version with your library releases
- `intent load` returns skill content from the installed package version
- Packaging code and skills together keeps their versions aligned

---

## Ongoing Maintenance (Manual or Agent-Assisted)

### 6. Set up the CI workflow

After running `setup`, you'll have `check-skills.yml` in `.github/workflows/`:

**check-skills.yml** (runs on PRs touching skills/artifacts, release, or manual trigger)

Validation:

- Validates SKILL.md frontmatter and structure
- Ensures files stay under 500 lines
- Automatically detects stale skills and coverage gaps after you publish a new release

Review handoff:

- Opens one grouped review PR with an agent-friendly prompt
- Includes the reason each skill or package was flagged
- Requires you to copy the prompt into Claude Code, Cursor, or your agent to update skills

### 7. Update stale skills

When you publish a new release, `check-skills.yml` automatically opens a PR flagging skills that need review.

Manually check which skills need updates with:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest stale
```

When run from a package, this checks that package's shipped skills. When run from a monorepo root, it checks workspace packages with skills and flags public workspace packages missing skill or `_artifacts` coverage.

This detects:
- **Version drift** — skill targets an older library version than currently installed
- **New sources** — sources declared in frontmatter that weren't tracked before
- **Artifact drift** — `_artifacts` entries that no longer match generated skills
- **Missing package coverage** — public workspace packages not represented by generated skills or artifact coverage

If a public workspace package is intentionally out of scope for skills, record that decision in repo-root `_artifacts`:

```yaml
coverage:
  ignored_packages:
    - '@tanstack/internal-tooling'
    - name: packages/devtools-fixture
      reason: test fixture only
```

Private workspace packages are skipped automatically.

**Prepare the update:**

1. Review the PR opened by `check-skills.yml`
2. Copy the agent prompt from the PR description
3. Paste it into Claude Code, Cursor, or your coding agent
4. The agent reads the stale skills and updates them based on library changes

**Finish the update:**

5. Run `npx @tanstack/intent@latest validate` locally to verify
6. Commit and merge the PR

> [!NOTE]
> Skills are updated through agent assistance, not full automation. The workflow detects what's stale and provides the prompt — your agent handles the actual updates.

Use `--json` output for CI integration or scripting.

### 8. Maintain and iterate

As your library evolves:

1. **When APIs change:** Update relevant SKILL.md files with new patterns
2. **When docs change:** Run `intent stale` to identify affected skills
3. **When issues are filed:** Check if the failure mode should be added to "Common Mistakes"
4. **After major releases:** Consider re-running domain discovery to catch new patterns

> [!TIP]
> Create GitHub issue labels matching your skill names (`skill:core`, `skill:react`). When users file issues, tag them with the relevant skill label to track which areas need the most improvement.
