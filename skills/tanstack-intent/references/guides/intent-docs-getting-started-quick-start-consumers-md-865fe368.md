## 1. Run install

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest install
```

Run this in an interactive terminal. On first use, Intent helps you choose which installed packages and skills your agent may use, then creates or updates skill-loading guidance.

Examples use `npx` for npm projects. In pnpm, Yarn, or Bun projects, use the matching runner: `pnpm dlx`, `yarn dlx`, or `bunx`.

1. **Choose what to enable.** Pick **Enable all**, **Choose packages or scopes**, or **Choose individual skills**. Package and skill lists support search.
2. **Confirm and finish.** Check the saved rules and destination `package.json`. Choose **Continue with all selected skills** to save, or **Review individual skills** to pick which selected packages to inspect before confirming. Intent writes permissions and guidance, verifies the guidance, and shows a command to list available skills.

**Enable all** saves `"*"`. A package choice saves `"@tanstack/ai"`; a whole scope saves `"@tanstack/*"`. These rules include future matching skills. Individual choices use `"@tanstack/ai#skill"`. Unchecking a skill during review adds an exclusion while keeping its broad rule.

Skill instructions can change when dependencies update. Update notifications are not available yet. See **About skill access and updates** in the installer for details.

Selecting nothing requires explicit confirmation to disable all skills. If no skills are found, or all are excluded, Intent explains the next step and leaves permissions and guidance unchanged. Install a package that ships skills or review your exclusions, then run `install` again.

Canceling before confirmation writes neither file. `--dry-run` previews the flow without writing. First-run setup requires a terminal; noninteractive execution fails without writes when permissions have not been configured.

If an `intent-skills` block already exists, Intent updates that file in place.
If no block exists, `AGENTS.md` is the default target.

Intent creates guidance like:

```markdown
<!-- intent-skills:start -->
## Skill Loading

Before editing files for a substantial task:
- Run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest list` from the workspace root to see available local skills.
- If a listed skill matches the task, run `pnpm dlx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` before changing files.
- Use the loaded `SKILL.md` guidance while making the change.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.
<!-- intent-skills:end -->
```

Intent detects the package manager when generating this block, so the runner may be `npx`, `pnpm dlx`, `yarn dlx`, or `bunx`.

To enforce loading guidance before edits in supported agents, opt in to hooks:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest hooks install
```

Project-scoped hooks are installed for Claude Code and Codex. `intent install` can write project guidance to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, but GitHub Copilot CLI hook enforcement is user-scoped, so configure it explicitly:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest hooks install --scope user --agents copilot
```

Cursor and generic `AGENTS.md` agents use the guidance block only.

Hooks return the available Intent skill catalog as context for supported agent sessions and keep the edit gate active until they observe a supported `intent load` command.

Hooks do not verify that:

- The command succeeded.
- The skill matched the task.
- The agent applied the guidance.

To control what appears in the session catalog, configure `intent.skills` and `intent.exclude` in `package.json`.

## 2. Review the saved permissions

`install` saves your choices in `package.json#intent.skills`, an allowlist of packages or individual skills. It uses the nearest `package.json` that owns the directory where you ran the command.

```json
{
  "intent": {
    "skills": ["@tanstack/react-query#core"]
  }
}
```

When permissions already exist, including inherited workspace permissions, `install` preserves them and only updates guidance. To change your choices, edit the owning `intent.skills` declaration. You can also use `*` package patterns such as `@tanstack/*`. Existing `intent.exclude` rules still take precedence. See the [source entries](./intent-docs-concepts-configuration-md-138c87c1.md#source-intent-docs-concepts-configuration-md) in Configuration and the [Trust model](./intent-docs-concepts-trust-model-md-2527dceb.md#source-intent-docs-concepts-trust-model-md).

## 3. Use skills in your workflow

Load a skill when it matches the task:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest load @tanstack/react-query#core
```

This prints the skill content for the installed package version.

Intent cannot guarantee that an agent selected the correct skill or followed its guidance. See [Lifecycle boundaries](./intent-docs-concepts-trust-model-md-2527dceb.md#source-intent-docs-concepts-trust-model-md).

If you want explicit task-to-skill mappings in your agent config, opt in:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest install --map
```

## 4. Keep skills up-to-date

```bash
npm update @tanstack/react-query
```

Skills version with library releases. Updating a library also updates its packaged skills, so the skill version matches the installed code. If a package is installed both locally and globally and global scanning is enabled, Intent prefers the local version.

List the installed skills:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest list
```

Use `--json` for machine-readable output:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest list --json
```

Global package scanning is opt-in:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest list --global
```

You can also check if any skills reference outdated source documentation:

```bash
npx @tanstack/intent@latest stale
```
