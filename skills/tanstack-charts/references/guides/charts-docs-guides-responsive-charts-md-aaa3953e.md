TanStack Charts treats width and height differently:

- width is normally measured from the chart container;
- height is a product decision supplied as pixels or an aspect ratio;
- scale factories infer domains while configured instances retain fixed domains;
- TanStack Charts copies those scales and assigns responsive pixel ranges.

This keeps a definition stable while the same chart moves between a dashboard
card, a split pane, and a full-width report.

## Container-responsive width

Omit `width` from `mountChart` or framework adapter options to follow the
container. The shared DOM host observes the container and updates only when
its measured width changes.

```ts
const host = mountChart(element, {
  definition,
  height: 320,
  ariaLabel: 'Weekly downloads',
})
```

The container must have a resolvable width. In grid and flex layouts, the
common requirement is `min-width: 0` on the grid or flex child:

```css
.chart-card {
  min-width: 0;
}
```

Supply `width` only when an application deliberately owns fixed geometry, such
as an export frame or a benchmark.

## Height and aspect ratio

Use one of these policies:

- `height`: fixed product height in CSS pixels;
- a positive, finite `aspectRatio`: derive height from the measured width;
- neither: use the host default.

Do not supply both as competing policies. A fixed height is usually more stable
for dashboards and scrolling pages. An aspect ratio is useful for editorial
layouts where the chart should scale as one visual block. Invalid ratios fall
back to the default height.

## Automatic guide space

Omit `margin` for normal charts. The scene solver reserves the minimum space
required by:

- formatted tick labels;
- rotated tick bounds;
- first and last tick overhang;
- axis titles;
- legends;
- inherited font metrics in a DOM host.

```ts group=responsive-long-labels env=charts file=/src/chart.ts entry
import { barX, defineChart } from '@tanstack/charts'
import { scaleBand } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/band'
import { scaleLinear } from '@tanstack/charts/scales/linear'
import { rows } from './data'

export default defineChart({
  marks: [
    barX(rows, {
      x: 'weeklyRequests',
      y: 'feature',
      fill: '#7c3aed',
      inset: 1,
    }),
  ],
  scales: {
    x: {
      scale: scaleLinear,
      nice: true,
      grid: true,
      axis: { ticks: { count: 5 }, label: 'Weekly requests' },
    },
    y: {
      scale: () => scaleBand<string>().padding(0.1),
    },
  },
})
```

```ts group=responsive-long-labels file=/src/data.ts collapsed
export const rows = [
  { feature: 'Self-service account recovery', weeklyRequests: 128 },
  { feature: 'Saved searches and alerting', weeklyRequests: 95 },
  { feature: 'Audit log export', weeklyRequests: 72 },
  { feature: 'Custom retention policies', weeklyRequests: 44 },
  { feature: 'Role-based access controls', weeklyRequests: 31 },
]
```

An explicit side locks only that side:

```ts
margin: {
  left: 96
}
```

`margin: 0` locks every side and is appropriate for guide-free sparklines.
Axis labels thin automatically after candidate generation and optional
rotation. Use `axis.ticks.spacing`, `axis.tickLabels.rotate`, hard-kept labels,
or a different representation when labels compete for the same axis space.

## Text measurement

Static scenes use deterministic text estimates. DOM and framework SVG hosts
measure painted text with the inherited container font and relayout after web
fonts finish loading.

Use `measureText` only when another renderer or layout system owns text
measurement. It runs synchronously during scene compilation and receives the
text plus the resolved font family, style, stretch, size, weight, letter
spacing, direction, locale, font scale, anchor, and baseline. It returns the
painted box relative to the requested origin. A host that loads fonts or
measures them asynchronously owns that readiness lifecycle and renders the
scene again when its synchronous metrics change.

The resolved geometry is available after every render:

```ts
const scene = host.getScene()

scene.margin
scene.chart
scene.scales
```

Use `scene.chart` to align application-owned overlays. Do not calculate a
parallel plot rectangle from guessed margins.

## Deterministic server output

A server cannot measure a future browser container. Supply `initialWidth` when
the initial SVG must have deterministic geometry:

```tsx
<Chart
  definition={definition}
  initialWidth={640}
  height={320}
  ariaLabel="Weekly downloads"
/>
```

The client adopts the real container width after hydration. Use the same
`initialWidth` for all requests that render the same layout; do not derive it
from browser-only APIs on the server.

See [SSR and Hydration](./charts-docs-guides-ssr-and-hydration-md-ff83bc62.md#source-charts-docs-guides-ssr-and-hydration-md) for the complete lifecycle.

## Responsive construction

Most data transforms should depend only on application data. The responsive
builder receives the full scene width and height, so it can choose breakpoints,
tick counts, or a surface-relative representation.

Those values are not the final inner plot bounds. Automatic guides and legends
resolve `scene.chart` after the builder returns. Exact plot-space collision,
binning, or label placement belongs in a custom mark's render phase, which
receives the final chart bounds and resolved scales, or in an application
overlay driven by `onRender`.

```ts
function summarizeRows(rows: Input['rows']) {
  return summarize(rows)
}

function createDefinition(rows: Input['rows']) {
  const summary = summarizeRows(rows)

  return defineChart(({ width }) =>
    buildResponsiveSpec(summary, {
      compact: width < 480,
    }),
  )
}
```

For a deliberately guide-free `margin: 0` scene, the full surface and inner
plot can coincide. Do not assume that equivalence for ordinary automatic
layout.

Responsive relayout commits immediately even when animation is enabled for
data updates. Set `svgAnimation: { resize: true }` only when size interpolation is
intentional.

The [Dynamic Data and Animation](./charts-docs-guides-dynamic-data-and-animation-md-f2a556c9.md#source-charts-docs-guides-dynamic-data-and-animation-md) guide explains
the two phases. The [D3 integration contract](./charts-docs-concepts-scales-and-d3-md-690870a4.md#source-charts-docs-concepts-scales-and-d3-md)
explains why application code should not set positional pixel ranges.

## Responsive checklist

- The container can shrink because its grid or flex child uses `min-width: 0`.
- Width is omitted unless fixed geometry is intentional.
- Height or aspect ratio is an explicit product choice.
- Scale domains remain semantic and independent from pixels.
- Automatic margins are enabled unless the chart is deliberately guide-free.
- Long labels are tested at the smallest supported width.
- Overlays use `scene.chart`, not duplicated margin math.
- SSR uses a deterministic `initialWidth`.
- Final plot-space work reads custom-mark render bounds or `scene.chart`.
