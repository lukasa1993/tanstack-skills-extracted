# Types — Overview

[Guide and prerequisites](./charts-docs-reference-types-md-686ca8ea.md) · Release-matched documentation · `@tanstack/charts@0.16.0`.

TanStack Charts is inference-first. A mark's source data and channel selectors
flow through its definition into scales, axis formatters, host and adapter
callbacks, focus callbacks, and selection callbacks. Normal application code
should not cast chart definitions or supply adapter generics.

Browser applications can import types from the package root. Platform-neutral
libraries can import the same definition, mark, scene, runtime, focus, and
tooltip-model contracts from `@tanstack/charts/types`; DOM host and renderer
types remain available from the root.
