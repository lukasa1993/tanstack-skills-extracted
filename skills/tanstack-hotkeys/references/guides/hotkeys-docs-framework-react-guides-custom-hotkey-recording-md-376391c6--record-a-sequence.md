## Record a sequence

Set `maxSteps: Infinity` to let users record a sequence. Each chord adds a step, and the recording commits when the user presses Enter, or after `idleTimeoutMs` without a new step:

```tsx
function SequenceRecorder() {
  const formatForDisplay = useFormatForDisplay()
  const recorder = useHotkeyRecorder({
    maxSteps: Infinity,
    onRecord: (hotkey) => console.log('Recorded:', hotkey), // 'Mod+S' or ['G', 'G']
  })

  return (
    <button onClick={recorder.isRecording ? recorder.cancelRecording : recorder.startRecording}>
      {recorder.isRecording
        ? formatForDisplay(recorder.steps) || 'Press chords, then Enter...'
        : recorder.recordedHotkey
          ? formatForDisplay(recorder.recordedHotkey)
          : 'Click to record'}
    </button>
  )
}
```

A one-step recording commits as a chord, so the result can always go straight to `useHotkey`. With `maxSteps: Infinity`, `onRecord` and `validate` receive a `Hotkey`, which can be a chord or a sequence. See [Sequences](./hotkeys-docs-framework-react-guides-sequences-md-00eadae7.md#source-hotkeys-docs-framework-react-guides-sequences-md) for how sequences match.
